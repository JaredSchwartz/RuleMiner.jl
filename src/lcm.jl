    LCM(txns::Transactions, min_support::Union{Int,Float64})::DataFrame

Identify frequent closed itemsets in a transactional dataset `txns` with a minimum support: `min_support`.

When an Int value is supplied to min_support, lcm will use absolute support (count) of transactions as minimum support.
When a Float value is supplied, it will use relative support (percentage).
